/-! # `H¹` case of `r.LeBron.2`: the approximation argument

Given the analytic-case Hölder bound (`hana`), the `L²` contraction of differences (`hdiff`),
existence (`hexist`) and the energy bound (`henergy`) for a fixed drift `b` and `κ`, a weak solution
with mean-zero `H¹` data is `ν`-Hölder in time with `ν = μ/(1+p)` and constant `∝ ‖θ₀‖_{H¹}`. -/
